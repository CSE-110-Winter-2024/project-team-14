# Successorator Application

## Overview
Successorator is a task management application designed to help users focus on their Most Important Tasks (MITs) for the day. With features such as entering multiple MITs, tracking completed tasks, and carrying over unfinished tasks to the next day, Successorator aims to enhance productivity and ensure that users can keep track of their progress over time.

## Features
- **Single MIT Success List**: Allows users to enter and check off their MIT for the day.
- **Multiple MITs**: Supports entering and checking off multiple MITs to ensure all critical tasks are managed.
- **Show Completed MITs**: Users can view their finished MITs for the day, providing a sense of accomplishment.
- **Date Display**: Displays the current day of the week and date for better orientation.
- **Carry Over Unfinished MITs**: Unfinished MITs automatically roll over to the next day.
- **Persist MITs**: Tasks are saved and persist even after the app restarts.
- **Move Finished MIT Back to Unfinished**: Offers flexibility in task management by allowing users to reclassify completed tasks as unfinished.
- **UI Mock for Date**: Includes a feature for manually advancing the date to test date-related functionalities.

## Software Design
- **Code Quality**: Ensures tidy, well-indented code with consistent naming and necessary comments.
- **MVP Design Pattern**: Utilizes the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern for a clean architectural approach.
- **SRP and DRY**: Emphasizes the Single Responsibility Principle and Don't Repeat Yourself to maintain a clean and efficient codebase.
- **Requirement Reflection**: The codebase is closely aligned with the outlined requirements, ensuring full coverage of functionalities.

## Testing
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Implements tests covering all non-trivial methods, excluding simple getters/setters.
- **Local Testing**: Integrates testing with tools like JUnit, Espresso, or Robolectric to facilitate automated local testing.
- **Continuous Integration**: Utilizes GitHub Actions for running tests, ensuring consistent code quality and functionality.

## GitHub Project Management
- **Prioritization and Sequencing**: Manages user stories in priority order, with iterations executed sequentially.
- **Task Assignment**: Tasks are appropriately assigned to developers, promoting balanced workload and collaboration.
- **Burnup Chart**: Maintains a burnup chart to visualize progress, highlighting completed stories and ongoing work.

## GitHub Practices
- **Team Contribution**: Demonstrates consistent use and contribution from all team members.
- **Issue Tracking**: Links pushes with GitHub Project issue numbers for traceability.
- **Branch Protection**: Protects the master branch, requiring passing tests on GitHub Actions and code review for pull requests.
- **Code Reviews**: Conducts meaningful code reviews for each story, ensuring quality and collaborative improvement.

## Participation and Collaboration
- **Active Participation**: Emphasizes collaborative work, expecting full team engagement during planning and development phases.
- **Pair Programming**: Encourages pair programming and group work for development tasks, enhancing learning and product quality.
- **Absence Management**: Handles absences through advance negotiation or timely communication with the instructional team, adhering to academic integrity requirements.

## Deadlines and Submissions
- **Timeliness**: Adheres to submission deadlines, with a grace period of 5 minutes. Late submissions face a penalty of 1% per minute.
- **Academic Integrity**: Maintains a private repository in the CSE 110 GitHub Classroom/Organization, as required for academic integrity and efficient collaboration.
